General ------------------------------------------------------------------- 

  This is eucherl, a command line client for the euchred euchre server.
  It is written in Perl.

  The purpose of this client is as a test client, so there is no long term
  caching of player name or anything.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Compiling ----------------------------------------------------------------- 

  The client is written in standard perl: the only Perl 5-isms are in
  the terminal stuff.  (See the BEGIN routine in config.pl.)

  The client needs access to ../common/message.pl.
