General

  This is a Perl client for the network euchre server called euchred.

  This package is currently in alpha testing, so expect things to break.
  However, with some luck it can be used to play a complete game of
  euchre.

  The package is copyrighted by me, Denis McLaughlin, and licensed under
  the GNU Public License.  God bless Richard Stallman.

Requirements

    The client will need a working Perl 5 install on a Unix system.  The
    client depends on various terminal escape codes (screen clearing and
    text highlighting) which have been tested on the linux console as
    well as an xterm.  Other terminal types may need some tweaking.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Making It

  The client is written in Perl, and so doesn't need to be compiled.  You'll
  find the eucherl client executable in the src directory.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Installing It

  We're still in alpha testing, so there is no installer yet.  The
  client assumes it will be run from its src/ directory.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Running It

  To run it:
    - cd src
    - ./eucherl

  Eucherl is single player client, so to actually have a game of euchre
  you'll either have to run four clients and try not to cheat, or find
  three friends who also have the client.

  If you're running the clients and server on the same system, the
  client's default server setting is fine.  Otherwise reset the server
  by running ./eucherl -s <servername>, or using the 's' command in the
  client to reset the server name.

  Once you've started the client, there is a state-sensitive help menu.
  In brief, 'c' to connect, and once four players have joined (you'll
  see them in the display), 's' to start the game.  Up and down arrows
  scroll the chat messages forward and backward (space to zip to the
  bottom), left and right arrow highlight options (when available),
  return selects the current highlighted option.
